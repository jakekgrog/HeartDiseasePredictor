# Heart disease predictor

> Heart disease predictor for college data mining project

Uses K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to predict whether a patient has heart disease (>50% narrowing of coronary arteries)

### Average accuracy ranges from 81% - 84%

Column 1:
- Age

Column 2:
- Sex
    - Value 0: Female
    - Value 1: Male

Column 3:
- Chest pain type
    - Value 0: asymptomatic
    - Value 1: atypical angina
    - Value 2: non-anginal pain
    - Value 3: typical angina

Column 4:
- Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to hospital)

Column 5:
- Serum cholestoral in mg/dl

Column 6:
- Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
    - Value 1: true
    - Value 0: false

Column 7:
- ECG
    - Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
    - Value 1: Normal
    - Value 2: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

Column 8:
- Maximum heart rate achieved

Column 9:
- Exercise induced angina 
    - Value 1: yes
    - Value 0: no

Column 10:
- ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

Column 11:
-  Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    - Value 0: downsloping; 
    - Value 1: flat; 
    - Value 2: upsloping

Column 12:
- Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy (4 = NaN)

Column 13:
- Value 1: fixed defect; 
- Value 2: normal; 
- Value 3: reversable defect

Column 14:
- Has greater than 50% narrowing of coronary arteries
    - Value 0: Yes (Has coronary heart disease)
    - Value 1: No (Does not have coronary heart disease)
